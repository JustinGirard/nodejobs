The `Processes` class provides a structured way to manage system processes associated with job execution. It addresses the challenge of controlling multiple subprocesses, tracking their statuses, and ensuring clean startup and shutdown procedures within a broader job management environment. Designed for developers working on automation, batch processing, or job scheduling systems, it facilitates robust process oversight by encapsulating common operations such as launching, monitoring, and terminating processes.

At its core, `Processes` employs a combination of process management techniques and database integration. It uses `psutil` to inspect and control system processes, maintains an internal registry of active subprocesses, and interacts with a persistent job database (`JobDB`) to associate processes with specific jobs. An important design pattern is its use of background threads, like `_reap_loop`, which periodically clean up completed processes to prevent resource leaks and keep the process registry current. This approach helps ensure that process handling remains efficient and reliable over time.

### Key Concepts & Responsibilities

- **Process Lifecycle Management:** Handles starting new subprocesses with specified commands, associating them with job identifiers, and maintaining references to active processes.
- **Process Lookup & Tracking:** Finds system processes based on stored job information, leveraging `psutil` to inspect process details and maintain an up-to-date registry.
- **Process Termination:** Provides mechanisms to stop processes gracefully, with retries if necessary, to ensure proper cleanup.
- **Process Monitoring:** Keeps a registry of active processes and periodically cleans up those that have finished, facilitating resource management.
- **Integration with Job Database:** Uses job records to link system processes with logical jobs, improving tracking and control capabilities.
- **Asynchronous Cleanup:** Implements background threads such as `_reap_loop` to handle process cleanup asynchronously, avoiding resource leaks and maintaining an accurate process registry.

### High-Level Usage Examples

**Instantiation of the `Processes` class:**

```python
from nodejobs.processes import Processes
from nodejobs.jobdb import JobDB

job_db = JobDB()
proc_manager = Processes(job_db=job_db)
```

**Starting a process for a specific job:**

```python
command = "python my_script.py"
job_id = "job-1234"
process = proc_manager.run(command=command, job_id=job_id)
```

**Listing currently managed processes:**

```python
active_processes = proc_manager.list()
for proc in active_processes:
    print(f"Process ID: {proc.pid}, Job ID: {proc.job_id}")
```

**Stopping a process associated with a particular job:**

```python
success = proc_manager.stop(job_id="job-1234")
if success:
    print("Process terminated.")
```

This setup illustrates how `Processes` can be integrated into a larger system, providing straightforward control over job-related processes with minimal fuss.### `__init__(self, job_db: JobDB) -> None`

- Initializes the `Processes` instance with a reference to a job database (`JobDB`) and starts a background thread to monitor process cleanup.
- **Parameters**  
• `job_db` (`JobDB`): The job database instance used for retrieving and updating job statuses.

- **Returns**  
• `None`: This constructor does not return a value but sets up internal state and background monitoring.

- **Raises**  
• No explicit exceptions documented, but potential errors could arise if `job_db` is invalid or thread creation fails.

- **Examples**  
```python
# Assuming JobDB is already instantiated as job_database
process_manager = Processes(job_database=job_database)
# Process manager is now monitoring processes in the background. 🔧
```

### `run(self, command: str, job_id: str, envs: dict = None, cwd: str = None, logdir: str = None, logfile: str = None) -> subprocess.Popen`

- Launches a subprocess with specified command and environment, logs output and errors, and tracks the process internally. It associates the process with a specific job ID.
- **Parameters**  
• `command` (`str`): The shell command to execute as a subprocess.  
• `job_id` (`str`): Identifier linking the process to a particular job record.  
• `envs` (`dict`, optional): Environment variables for the subprocess. Defaults to `None`.  
• `cwd` (`str`, optional): Directory in which to execute the command. Defaults to `None`.  
• `logdir` (`str`, optional): Directory to store log files. Defaults to `None`.  
• `logfile` (`str`, optional): Specific log filename. Defaults to `None`.  

- **Returns**  
• `subprocess.Popen`: The process handle for the launched subprocess.  

- **Raises**  
• `FileNotFoundError`: If the command executable is not found.  
• `OSError`: If process creation fails.  

- **Examples**  
```python
import subprocess
# Assuming job_db is already created
proc_manager = Processes(job_database=job_db)
process_handle = proc_manager.run(
    command='echo Hello World',
    job_id='job123',
    envs={'EXAMPLE': 'value'},
    cwd='/tmp'
)
# Process is now running, logs are being written. 🚀
```

### `find(self, job_id: str) -> psutil.Process or None`

- Searches for a system process associated with a specific job ID by referencing the job database and inspecting system processes.
- **Parameters**  
• `job_id` (`str`): The identifier of the job whose process is sought.  

- **Returns**  
• `psutil.Process` or `None`: The process object if found, otherwise `None`.  

- **Raises**  
• No explicit exceptions, but could raise `psutil.NoSuchProcess` internally if process disappears during search.  

- **Examples**  
```python
# Locate the process for a specific job
process_obj = proc_manager.find('job123')
if process_obj:
    print(f"Found process with PID: {process_obj.pid}")
else:
    print("Process not found.")
# Checks for a process linked to 'job123'. 🔍
```

---

### `stop(self, job_id: str) -> bool`

- Attempts to terminate the process associated with the given job ID, potentially trying multiple times for shell processes.
- **Parameters**  
• `job_id` (`str`): The identifier of the job to stop.  

- **Returns**  
• `bool`: `True` if the stop command was issued (regardless of success), `False` otherwise.  

- **Raises**  
• No explicit exceptions; internal calls may raise `psutil.NoSuchProcess` if process is already terminated.  

- **Examples**  
```python
# Stop a running job
success = proc_manager.stop('job123')
if success:
    print("Job stopped successfully.")
else:
    print("Failed to stop the job.")
# Attempts to terminate process associated with 'job123'. 🚧
```

---

### `list(self) -> list`

- Retrieves a list of all system processes that are currently associated with job records in the database.
- **Parameters**  
• None.  

- **Returns**  
• `list`: A list of `psutil.Process` objects representing active job processes, each with an added `job_id` attribute.  

- **Raises**  
• No explicit exceptions; potential `psutil.Error` if process enumeration fails.  

- **Examples**  
```python
# List all active processes associated with jobs
active_processes = proc_manager.list()
for proc in active_processes:
    print(f"Process ID: {proc.pid}, Job ID: {proc.job_id}")
# Lists all processes tied to existing job records. 🔎
